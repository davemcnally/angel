All of the essentials are here from hooks, leads and clips to safety tubing, swivels and PVA. Your breakfast and evening meals are taken care of each day and you can also purchase snacks during the day if you wish! From soft drinks and beer to baguettes and chocolate. Tea and coffee is available 24 hours a day and we have a dining area with decking overlooking the lake where you can relax, eat and socialise with other anglers. We have a fully functioning, modern, clean English toilets and shower block too, including a separate women’s toilet. English Bailiffs are on hand 24 hours a day to help you out if/when you need it.

                <p class="pageMain">We are currently offering a range of fantastic baits from Munch Baits — The Compound and BioMarine. We also sell our own low oil, high protein pellet mix which the lakes are fed with all year round, making for great fish health and weights all year round. Please do not bring your own baits with you as you will not be able to use them. We monitor the quality of baits going into the lake and like to make sure our fish are getting only the best of what they need. We have confidence in the bait we’re using and feeding with at the lake. Our pellet is £20 for 10 Kilo and our fresh freezer bait is £11/Kilo.</p>

                <p class="pageMain">Our equipment is constantly reviewed and renewed when needed, ensuring you have the best tackle available and can rest in comfort during your stay! Currently, we’re using: TFG Lock-Down Twin Skin Bivvy, TFG 3-Leg Bedchair, Stainless Goalpost Pods, Fox Buzzers and Swingers, TFG Delta XS 3lb TC Rods and Shimano 8000 Baitrunners loaded with 15lb Big Game.</p>
                <p class="pageMain">To compliment the tackle, each angler also has their own Reuben Heaton tripod, JRC Scales, Nash Euro Cradle and Weigh Sling and a large Fox landing net. Once you’ve had a look around and decided on a swim, it’s time to pick your bait of choice and get it out there! We can help with that too — the bailiff is on hand to give you any help you need and choosing spots to fish on and baiting up if required. You can either make use of one of our excellent Viper Storm bait boats for <% include partials/boatprice.ejs %> for the entire week or take the rowing boat out and spread your baits over a larger area. All you need to bring is your terminal tackle and you’re ready to go! Don’t forget your headtorches — A lot of our carp like to make an appearance during the night and you’ll want to see where you’re going!</p>
