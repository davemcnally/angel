# Angel Lakes

> An Express-flavored build of the Angel Lakes site.

A rewrite of my existing design, porting the site from Webhook to Express. Partially out of need, and partially as an exercise to learn a bit about Express. This is my first time working with Express, or any Node framework for that matter so please excuse the rookie errors!

You are more than welcome to learn from this code and adapt it for your own projects but that’s where the limitation ends — the code is provided for educational purposes but the site design and style is not. Please respect that when considering cloning/forking this to make something of your own.
